- Do not use vertical alignment for variables, arrays, objects, doc block comments anywhere in the code.
- Use tabs for spacing
- Opening brackets should go on the next line.
- Use doc block for all objects, methods, classes, and properties. Add params and return properties.
- Do not use react or typescript.
- Always use semi colons where they should be.

- props objects should be on the same line if the props are one line including the opening bracket for the children array.
here is an example of that:
Card({ class: "flex items-center", margin: "m-2" }, [

]);
