# Base Example App Shell

## Framework Overview

This is an example app shell for the Base Framework. It is a simple, single page application that demonstrates the framework's capabilities. The app shell is a good starting point for creating your own application.

## Layouts

This app uses components and atoms to create layouts. Components are reusable layouts that contain the presentation and functionality. They are reusable and extensible, helping to reduce redundant code through abstract types.

## Getting Started

To begin using the Base Framework, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/chrisdurfee/next-app-shell.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd next-app-shell
```
3. Install dependencies (ensure Node.js is installed):
```bash
npm install
```

4. Run the development server using Vite:
```bash
npm run dev
```
